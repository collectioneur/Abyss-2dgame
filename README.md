The game revolves around a girl who finds herself trapped in a cave infested with monsters, and her objective is to survive for as long as possible without being eaten. The core gameplay mechanics include managing limited ammunition and sword strikes while navigating through the cave. I meticulously crafted the game physics from scratch, encompassing movement, rotation, shooting mechanics, bullet collisions with monsters, sword strikes, and the nuanced behavior of each monster, including their movement patterns and damage infliction. Additionally, the game features a comprehensive statistics system and multiple tabs providing detailed descriptions of the various monsters encountered.
